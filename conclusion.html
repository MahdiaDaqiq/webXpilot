    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
    <h2>Discussion of Results</h2>
    <p> After doing some short training on Dumpster, the fuzzy xpilot agent, it is clear that it is possible to train the agent to learn the best fuzzy to beat its opponent. If given enough time to run around, the fuzzy agent will learn how to adjust its fuzzy logic so that it doesn't run into walls. The same thing applies for bullet avoidance and killing. The hardest part of the project was definetly to make the training environment and the fitness function as good as possible for the robot to learn the desired behavior. Our training environment didn't switch the position of the agent, and when we tried to move the agent to different positions the fitness function became extremely difficult to implement and to calculate a fair fitness between the starting points. The other major difficulty was to find an aggressive agent that is not overly aggressive so that some learning can take place. Possible solutions might have been to use a much bigger map or farther spawning spots. It was also difficult to find a perfect fitness function to make the agent prioritize killing but also survival. Finding a balance of point distribution between survival time and killing time was relatively laborious. At least, the training has shown some improvement for both Rabbit and Dumpster, which was somewhat great even though it was not as great as expected. Some more training with different fitness functions and maybe some more rules to the agents would have been great, but due to time issues it was not possible.    
    </p>
    <h2>Future Work</h2> 
    <p> Further research in using a genetic algorithm on fuzzy logic system is definetly worthwhile pursuing. It was already proven that xpilot agents utilizing fuzzy logic can outperform simple production based agents. Therefore, it would be great if a way to train the robot correctly to find optimal fuzzy sets function is found. It would get rid of the tweaking process of the fuzzy logic system by trial and errors that humans will usual pursue in the making of a good fuzzy logic agent. It would be great to see if the agent would become even smarter as the complexity of the fuzzy sets grows as the ones used in this research are relatively simple (2 and 3 possibilities per set).
