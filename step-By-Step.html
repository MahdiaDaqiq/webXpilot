    <h1>Detailed Process of Project</h1>
    <h2>Planification of Project</h2>
    <p> The first and most important thing we did as a team is divide the entire project into different smaller problems and assigned these to one another based on our strengths. It was determine that we should begin by making the opposing agents that our fuzzy logic agent played against. After consultation, it was set that we would have to make three different agents: one aggressive smart agent, one defensive smart agent, and one fuzzy agent that would use a genetic algorith. These agents were named "TigerKing", "Rabbit" and "Dumpster" respectively. 
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bullets">Dumpster - An Evolving Xpilot Fuzzy Agent</li> 
      <li class="bullets">Rabbit - Xpilot Offensive Agent</li> 
      <li class="bullets">Tiger King - Xpilot Defensive Agent</li> 
    </ul>
    <h2>Creating Rabbit</h2> 
    <p>Rabbit was estblish to be the more defensive type agent that our fuzzy agent would play against. To make it relatively defensive, we developed a genetic algorithm that has a fitness score based on survival. Basically, Rabbit would get points for the longer it stays alive and some minor penalties if it gets killed by the other agent or if it crashes into a wall. It was crucial to make Rabbit learn before it faced Dumpster as the goal was to have Dumpster play a smartt defensive agent. The training of Rabbit was done against one of the robots that the xpilot game push into the game when allowed. These robots are extremely aggressive as they tend to follow and attack the opposing robot right away and it does not give up until it either dies or make the kill. The results of the training were relatively good. Rabbit learned how to stay alive longer over time until it hit a certain point in its learning.The following variables were coontrolled inside the production system by the genetic algorithm: frontwall_Alert, backwall_Alert, slowtrackwall_Alert, fasttrackwall_Alert, Enemy_Alert and finally Bullet_alert. All of these variables were necessary for the wall avoidance rules, the bullet avoidance rules, the shooting rules and the turning rules. The genetic algorithm as composed of 32 chromosmes total with a population totalling 64 individuals for each generation. A crossover rate of 70% and a mutation rate of 1% were used during training. The selection process was done by choosing the individuals with a better fitness. In other words, the more fitted an individual was the more chance the individual would have to reproduce and even survive. 
    </p> 
    <h2>Creating TigerKing</h2>
    <p>TigerKing was made exactly like Rabbit except for its fitness function. Instead of allowing more score for staying alive, the method allowed a greater score when the agent would make a kill. There was also a time factor involved, where the faster TigerKing would make a kill to end the round, the more fitness would be given. It also had the same chromosome size, population size and rates as Rabbit. The training on TigerKing did not go as planned. It barely trained at all and that might have been due to the fact that the eother agent it was facing was not great at all and therefore TigerKing killed the agent in a relatively short period of time straight from the first generation. 
    </p> 
    <h2>Dumpster -- Imploying a GA to Fuzzy Sets</h2>
    <p> Dumpster was already a fuzzy agent that worked well for the simple.xp map in xpilot. It has proven itself many times as it won one of the in-class round-robin tournaments. The challenge here was to implement a genetic algorithm on its already formed fuzzy sets. Dumpster had two fuzzy sets: one for closing rate and one for distance from the wall. The fuzzy set for closing rate was based off tracking as well as speed was made of three variables: slow, medium and fast. As for the distance from the wall it had only 2 different variables: close, far. The goal was to make the fuzzy sets take all sort of different value range to eventually figure out which of all possible values where the best ones to define each variables with the fuzzy sets. Although some freedom was wanted, some limits also needed to bee respected. For example, the slow variable should not have a higher value than the fast variable, as it does not make any sense. Therefore, some key rules were implemented to make the fuzzy sets respectable while also having some freedom in their range of values. The first rule was that the variables should stay in their respective order. The second rule was that the membership of each variable should be somewhat fuzzy and not binary. The third and final restriction was that each set should have a membership at all times. The implementation of the fuzzy agent happened relatively smootly. First, we set the key values for each variable (when membership is 1 and when membership is 0). The top values were set first and the bottom values were than set based-off the top ones. The goal was then to train the agent against a defensive smart agent and an aggresive one to see how it would adjust its fuzzy sets. 
    </p>
    <h2>Training of Agents</h2>
    <p> The training was done using an ubuntu machine. It was not the best scenario as our team was obligated to use a VPN on our Macbook machine to get to a PC machine on Connecticut College campus, which had an ubuntu machine installed on it. The overall system was extremely laggy as Xpilot ran extremely slow compared to the usual. Thee usual refers here to the Linux machine available on college's campus.
